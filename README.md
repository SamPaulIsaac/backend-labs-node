## Overview

**Backend Labs â€“ Node.js** is part of a multi-language initiative to explore backend architecture, service design, and core systems engineering through practical experimentation. This Node.js variant focuses on:

- Building lightweight services using **Express.js**
- Experimenting with middleware, async patterns, and routing structures
- Exploring integration with databases, message queues, and external APIs
- Comparing backend behavior across stacks (Java, Go, Ruby, etc.)

Each lab is designed to be independent, focused, and easy to run.

---

## Technology Stack

- Node.js 18+
- Express.js
- MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- Redis
- RabbitMQ / Kafka (planned)
- JavaScript (TypeScript optional for later)

---

## Repository Structure

Each experiment or concept is structured as a self-contained module:
- apps/ # Individual backend services or experiments
- notes/ # Technical notes and architecture discussions
- scripts/ # Utility or setup scripts (optional)

  
## Each app folder includes:
- Its own `README.md`
- Clear entry point (usually `index.js` or `app.js`)
- Isolated `package.json` (if needed)
